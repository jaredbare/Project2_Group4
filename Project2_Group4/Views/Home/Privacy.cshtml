            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We promise not to sell your personal information, unless someone offers us a lifetime supply of pizza. In that case, all bets are off.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>We love cookies, but not the ones that come from your browser. We promise not to track your cookies, but we can't promise we won't steal your actual cookies if we see them lying around.</p>

            <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
            <p>We promise not to share your information with anyone who isn't authorized to use it, except for our mom. She's pretty trustworthy.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>We take security very seriously. That's why we've hired a team of highly trained cats to guard our servers. They may look cute, but they are fierce when it comes to protecting your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Updates</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to update this policy at any time, without warning. So, you might want to check back every once in a while to see what new shenanigans we're up to.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thanks for trusting us with your data! We promise to treat it with the utmost respect, unless we accidentally spill coffee on it. In that case, we'll just blame the interns.</p>
